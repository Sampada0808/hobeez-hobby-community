# üêù Hobeez + CometChat Integration

This branch integrates **CometChat UI Kit** into the Hobeez app to enable **group chat functionality** between hobby communities. The integration uses **CometChatUIKitSwift** within a SwiftUI-based project.

---

## üß© Project Overview

**Hobeez** is a hobby-sharing app where users can join or create hobby-based groups and interact with others. The app is built using SwiftUI, and for this branch, CometChat's UI Kit has been used to embed **real-time group chat** support.

Main goals of this integration:
- Integrate group chat with CometChat UI Kit in a SwiftUI project.
- Ensure smooth login/logout and message exchange between multiple users.
- Maintain SwiftUI-first architecture while embedding UIKit-based CometChat components.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Faced During Integration

### 1. UIKit vs SwiftUI Integration
- **Problem:** The official CometChat UI Kit examples were built using UIKit, while Hobeez uses SwiftUI.
- **Impact:** Direct integration wasn‚Äôt straightforward, as CometChat's view controllers and components needed to be hosted inside SwiftUI views.

### 2. Lack of Backend Integration
- **Problem:** The app currently runs on dummy data. Real-time interactions such as chat metadata and group syncing are pending.
- **Impact:** While chat appears functional in the UI, backend connection and group management features are incomplete.

---

## ‚úÖ Solutions for the problems

### 1. UIViewControllerRepresentable Wrappers
- **Solution:** The UIKit chat views were wrapped using `UIViewControllerRepresentable` to embed them inside SwiftUI views.
- **Approach:** Code was broken down into chunks to understand and convert each UIKit component (e.g., `CometChatMessageList`, `CometChatMessageComposer`) into SwiftUI-friendly views.

### 2. SwiftUI-Based Login Interface
- A simple CometChat login interface using CometChatUIKit.login was implemented to test real-time group chat with multiple predefined users.

### ‚ùó Limitations
- App currently uses dummy data for users and messages
- Backend integration is pending ‚Äî messages are not persisted or synced
